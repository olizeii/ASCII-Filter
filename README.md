Save the files into one folder. Download node.js.
Open your CMD, write 
<br>
<br>
```npm install``` 
<br>
<br>
after that type 
<br>
<br>
```npm start```
<br>
<br>
after that the programm should launch, to Exit just press "Esc"
<br>
<br>
After some changes you know can write
<br>
<br>
```npm start -- --size=4```
<br>
<br> 
```npm start -- --charset=ABC```
<br>
<br> 
The size command changes how many pixels(real) get changed into ASCII (less size more acuracy)
<br>
<br>
### UPDATE:

> Added the --charset command //12.09.2025
